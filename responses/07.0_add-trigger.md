Great! Your learner now has information about what they're expected to do in this step of the course.

### Events
Every step in a course will be triggered by a GitHub Event. All possible events are documented in [Events Types & Payloads on the GitHub Developer Guide](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/).

## Step 8: Add an event
Let's now find the `event` that will trigger the step. Because we want the learner to open a new Pull Request, the event we're looking for is `pull_request.opened`.

### :keyboard: Add an event
1. Add an `event` for the first step
