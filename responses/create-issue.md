Great! Now let's work on the `before:` block. Anything in this block will occur before the learner gets access to the repo Learning Lab will create for them.

We'll use the `createIssue` action to create an issue for the learner with some initial instructions. The `createIssue` action requires two options:
- a title
- the body of the response

We'll define both of those here, but we'll create the body in the next step. You can edit the file manually or accept the suggested changes below. Since there are multiple suggested changes, you can go to the "Files changed tab" and accept them as a batch.
