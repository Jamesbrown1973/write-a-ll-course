Great! Now, the repository will have an issue for the learner.

## Step 6: Creating a response

In the last step, we referenced a file title `welcome-text.md`, but it doesn't exist. Learning Lab automatically looks in the `responses/` directory for all content files. Let's add it.

### :keyboard: Activity: Adding a response

1. In the `/responses/` folder, create a new file titled `welcome-text.md`
  - Note: If you're working on GitHub.com, you may need to navigate to the **Code** tab, checkout to the `add-metadata` branch, and click **Create new file**
1. In that file, add some content that will appear to the learner in the welcome issue
1. Add an instruction for the learner to open a new pull request titled "Add name to README" in which they add their name to the README file
