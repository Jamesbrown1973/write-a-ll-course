### Step 10: Add validation
We need to validate against the learner's pull request title. This information is accessible to us from the payload that is sent with the API. In this case, the information was sent from a `pull_request.opened`  event.

We'll add the `left:` option to the gate, and set it to the pull request's title.

A completed example of this would look like:
```yaml
actions:
- type: gate
  left: '%payload.pull_request.title%'
  operator: ===
  right: Add name to README
```
