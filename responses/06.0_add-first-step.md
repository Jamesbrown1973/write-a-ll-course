Great! The learner's repository will now be setup with a single issue.

### Steps in Learning Lab
Let's now dive into the `steps:`. This block is composed of [:book: steps](https://github.github.com/learning-lab-equipment/#/3-3-writing-steps) that are triggered by [`events` on GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/), and in turn certain `actions` take place. **`actions` in this context are NOT the same as GitHub Actions.**

Each step maps directly to something that the user will do. User interaction on GitHub triggers the step, and Learning Lab responds. The user interaction could be creating a pull request, closing an issue, or editing a file. When designing a course, it's important to plan for the user interactions to reflect what you want them to learn.

For example, you _could_ write a lot of text and have the user close the issue when they're done. But, unless your text was telling them how to close an issue, that reaction doesn't make sense. Try to find a way to have the user demonstrate their knowledge, like by committing a function to a branch. Let the user _show_ they understand to trigger the next step.

See [:book: best practices](https://github.github.com/learning-lab-equipment/#/3-5-responses?id=best-practices) in the Learning Lab docs for more suggestions.

## Step 7: Naming our first step

Let's name our first step. We will give it a **title** and a **description**. These will be shown on Learning Lab, and they help course authors stay organized in the `config.yml` file. The docs show [:book: syntax and examples](https://github.github.com/learning-lab-equipment/#/3-4-yaml?id=relevant-syntax-1) of how steps are shown to the learner.
