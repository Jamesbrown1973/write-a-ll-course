Great! The learner's repository will now be setup.

### Steps in Learning Lab
Let's now dive into the `steps:`. This block is composed of steps that are triggered by `events` on GitHub, and in turn certain `actions` take place. **`actions` in this context are NOT the same as GitHub Actions.**

Each "step" maps directly to something that the user will do. User action triggers the step, and Learning Lab responds. The user action could be creating a pull request, closing an issue, or editing a file. When designing a course, it's important to plan for the user actions to reflect what you want them to learn.

For example, you _could_ write a lot of text and have the user close the issue when they're done. But, unless your text was telling them how to close an issue, that reaction doesn't make sense. Try to find a way to have the user demonstrate their knowledge, like by committing a function to a branch. Let the user _show_ they understand to trigger the next step.

## Step 7: Naming our first step

Let's name our first step. We will give it a **title** and a **description**. These will be shown on Learning Lab, and they help course authors stay organized in the `config.yml` file.

### :keyboard: Activity: Naming our first step

1. Add a `title` and `description` for the first step
