# Welcome!

If you look around this repository, you'll find a few standard template files in your Code tab. These contain most of what you need to get a Learning Lab course up and running.

But, we need to fill in some of the missing fields. To kick things off, I've started a branch with the first changes.

### New to GitHub?

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

You'll also need a general understanding of webhooks and the GitHub API.  [The Getting started with GitHub Apps course]({{ host}}/courses/getting-started-with-github-apps) is a good place to start.

## Step 1: Open a pull request

The first step for creating a Learning Lab course is to have a `config.yml` file. We've gotten one started for you in the `add-metadata` branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Open a pull request

1. [Open a pull request]({{ prUrl }}) with base `master`, and comparing the `add-metadata` branch.
