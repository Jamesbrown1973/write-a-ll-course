# Welcome!

:running_woman: If you look around this repository, you'll find a few standard template files in your Code tab. These contain most of what you need to get a Learning Lab course up and running. You can take this code as-is and create a Learning Lab course on your own.

- If you'd like to work on your own, close this pull request and we'll provide instructions on how to transfer the course to your own organization.

### Documentation 

:book: The official [Learning Lab docs](https://github.github.com/learning-lab-equipment/#/) contain full instructions on how to create courses. We'll link to the docs throughout the course. Take a look if you'd like more information about steps we take in this course.

### New to GitHub?

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

You'll also need a general understanding of webhooks and the GitHub API.  [The Getting started with GitHub Apps course]({{ host}}/courses/getting-started-with-github-apps) is a good place to start.
