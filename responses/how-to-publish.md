Since Learning Lab courses must be owned by your organization, you'll need to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the course and template repositories there first. Here are the instructions:

## Publish the course
1. Choose an organization that will house your Learning Lab courses. You may have done this prior to taking the course.
1. Confirm that you are an owner of the chosen Learning Lab course organization, or a member of a team named **lab-assistants** in that organization.
1. [Fork this repository]({{ url }}) to your chosen organization.
1. [Fork the template repository](https://github.com/githubtraining/lab-starter-template/fork) to your chosen organization.
1. Navigate to `https://lab-sandbox.github.com/YOUR-ORGANIZATION/new`
1. In the Repository name field, type in **{{ repo }}**
1. We recommend selecting **Private** so you can test the course with other members of the organization before making it public.
1. Take the course, which should be available at https://lab-sandbox.github.com/YOUR-ORGANIZATION/{{ repo }}
