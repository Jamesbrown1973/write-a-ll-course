# Welcome!

If you look around this repository, you'll find a few standard template files in your Code tab which contains most of what you need to get a Learning Lab course up and running.

However, we need to fill in some of the missing fields. To kick things off, I've started a branch with the first changes.

### New to GitHub?

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

You'll also need a broad understanding of webhooks and the GitHub API, which are covered in [the Getting started with GitHub Apps course]({{ host}}/courses/getting-started-with-github-apps),

### :keyboard: Activity: Open a PR

1. [Open a pull request]({{ prUrl }}) against `add-metadata`.
